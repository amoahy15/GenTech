Virtuoso is a social platform for artists, art connoisseurs, and the casual enjoyer to come together and critique, rate, and annotate pieces. Virtuoso seeks to provide a robust variety of art galleries/exhibits, pieces, and collages that tailors to every userâ€™s specific experience and preferences.

Virtuoso is accessible at https://virtuoso-419315.web.app/
## Audience
* Virtuoso was inspired by online stories of art lovers wishing they had a place to review art, in an environment akin to sites like Letterboxd and Goodreads. Utilizing our knowledge of art history courses and how students dissect specific components of a work, we decided to also include annotations to emulate an art history classroom and foster discussion.

* Reviews
  * We recognized that the art community wished to write reviews and rate works of art, so we allowed users to write a single review, including a star rating on a 5-point scale, and to comment on the overall work, with both being optional features for a user's review.
