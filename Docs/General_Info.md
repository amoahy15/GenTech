### Reviews
  * We recognized that the art community wished to write reviews and rate works of art, so we allowed users to write a single review, including a star rating on a 5-point scale, and to comment on the overall work, with both being optional features for a user's review.

### Finding Images and Users
    * There are two ways of finding artwork, the first being via the 'Gallery' or 'Collections' page. This page has capabilities to display a number of collections dependent on attributes such as period, artist, and media.
